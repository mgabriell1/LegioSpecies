# LegioSpecies - an updated and referenced list of Legionellaceae species

LegioSpecies is an updated list of species belonging to the family Legionellaceae which includes referenced information regarding their clinical association and environments of isolation.\
The list is provided in three formats:

\- `LegioSpecies_list.pdf`: list of species, their ICNP status and found clinical associations and environmental isolation sources. Sources of information are presented through their DOI.

\- `LegioSpecies_list.csv`: machine readable list in `csv` format. Clinical associations and isolation sources and their references (in DOI format) are split in different columns. Information and its source are in the same order in the two types of columns and each element is delimited by `;` (i.e., the DOI for the first isolation source will be the first in its column).

\- `LegioSpecies_list_easy.pdf`: a version with embedded links to relevant publications.

The species list is mainly based on the ICNP list of species available [here](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/legionella), while information regarding clinical association and environment of isolation were retrieved by members of the DrinkMic group at Eawag (CH) (see below for contributing members). "Clinical association" is defined as being isolated from a patient. Environmental isolation sources are not exhaustive.
